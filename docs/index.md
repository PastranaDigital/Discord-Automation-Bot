# Overview

## How it started

As the owner for a local Pokemon Discord server, my friends and I began the discussion of some actions we repeat often. We wrote out the path that is commonly executed when a player is looking for the best performing deck on [play.limitlesstcg.com](https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournaments) from recent tournament results.

Then I discovered this video... :material-youtube: [Code Your Own Discord Bot - Basics (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JlD7gCZRs)

The code and solution began to come together from there.
